# Authentication and Authorization Enhancements for MCP

Authorization in context of MCP usually refers to two distinct flows or grant types:

- Agent acting on-behalf of a user: in this case the Agent takes the identity of the end-user (human). For example, an Agent invoked by an application as a result of a user asking a question in a chatbot will use the user's identity for authentication and authorization.

- Agent acting on its own behalf: in this case the Agent gets invoked automatically in response to an event and thus the Agent has its own identity. For example a network remediation agent that gets invoked when a network anomaly is detected will have an identity of its own as it is not being invoked by a user.

The latest MCP authorization spec available [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/authorization) discusses this in context of OAuth Grant types.

## The challenge with MCP auth in an enterprise scenario

The current MCP spec puts the onus of authentication on the MCP server i.e. the server is responsible for providing access credentials to the MCP client as well as validating those credentials (see [OAuth for model context protocol](https://aaronparecki.com/2025/04/03/15/oauth-for-model-context-protocol) for an illustrative explanation). This implies that developers now have to add Auth capabilities in their MCP servers and in an enterprise scenario with hundreds of MCP servers and thousands of tools this is a huge challenge. The problem is compounded by the fact that enterprises would want to offer fine-grained access controls to tools (an Agent can access the server but only a subset of the tools provided by the server) for both the types of Agent flows described above.

## A Solution with an MCP Gateway and Registry

The MCP gateway and Registry provides an enterprise ready solution that integrates with an IdP and provides a separate auth server which handles all authorization and authentication by talking to an IdP and this frees up the MCP servers from having to handle any authentication.

Here is an architecture diagram of the system.

    %% Footnotes
    Note over Agent,MCP: Notes:<br/>• Agent can skip tool discovery and call MCP methods directly<br/>• Auth validation flow remains the same for all MCP operations<br/>  (initialize, tools/call with tool-specific scope validation)
```

1. An Agent gets auth credentials from an enterprise IdP either by itself (agent identity) or is provided these credentials (on-behalf of user's identity) that have been retrieved by the (human) user through a separate program (such as signing-in via a web browser or a CLI command).

1. The Agent embeds these credentials and other metadata needed to verify these credentials in HTTP headers for the MCP protocol messages exchanged with the MCP servers.

1. The MCP servers are only accessible through the Gateway (reverse proxy), upon receiving the messages the Gateway hands them off to an auth server which validates the credentials embedded in the these messages with the enterprise IdP. This validation includes both authentication as well as authorization. The auth server retrieves the access scope for the Agent from the IdP auth validation response and then compares it with the MCP method (`initialize`, `tools/call` etc.) and tool being requested. The auth server responds with a 200 OK if the access should be allowed based on the credentials provided and the scope requested or a an HTTP 403 access denied otherwise. The auth server also includes the list of allowed scopes in its 200 OK response.

1. The Gateway then proceeds to pass on the request to the MCP server to which the request was addressed to in case the access was allowed (200 OK from the auth server) or sends the 403 access denied to the Agent. 

1. An Agent uses the same mechanism to talk to the Registry's MCP server for tool discovery. The Agent may request access to a special tool discovery tool available via the Registry's MCP server. The tool discovery tool now has access to the Agent's scope (through the auth server including the scope in the response headers for the 200 OK) and applies the scopes while searching for potential tools that the Agent can have access to, thus it only lists the tools that the Agent has access to in its response via the tool discovery tool. Here is a example scenario, a general purpose AI assistant may be able to discover through the tool finder tool that there is a tool to get the current time at a given location but based on its access it may not have access to a tool to determine stock information and hence the Registry never list the stock information tool as an available tool to the Agent (if the Agent knows about this tool through some out of band mechanism and tries to invoke the tool it would get an access denied as explained in the previous steps).

The above implementation provides an OAuth compliant way to MCP security without the MCP servers being involved in enforcing this security greatly simplifying the MCP server implementation (as compared to every MCP server having to implement authentication and authorization).


## Amazon Cognito based reference implementation

This section discusses the reference implementation using Amazon Cognito as the IdP, supporting both Machine-to-Machine (M2M) and Session Cookie authentication methods.

>This section will soon be updated with detailed steps for Cognito configuration.

### Key Components

#### 1. Auth Server (`auth_server/server.py`)
The auth server provides dual authentication support:
- **Primary Check**: Session cookie validation using `itsdangerous.URLSafeTimedSerializer`
- **Fallback**: JWT token validation with Cognito
- **Group Mapping**: Maps Cognito groups to MCP scopes via `scopes.yml` configuration
  - Both M2M and session cookie auth use the same scope definitions

#### 2. CLI Authentication Tool (`auth_server/cli_auth.py`)
A standalone tool for user-based authentication:
- Implements OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow with Cognito hosted UI
- Opens browser for user authentication
- Runs local callback server on port 8080
- Creates session cookie compatible with registry format
- Saves to `~/.mcp/session_cookie` with secure permissions (0600)

#### 3. Agent (`agents/agent_w_auth.py`)
The agent supports both authentication methods:
- `--use-session-cookie` flag for session-based auth
- `--session-cookie-file` parameter (default: `~/.mcp/session_cookie`)
- Maintains full backward compatibility with M2M authentication
- Automatically includes appropriate headers based on auth method

### 1. Machine-to-Machine Authentication

Cognito supports machine-to-machine authentication, enabling Agents to have their own identity separate from user identity.

#### Implementation Details:
- Reference: [AWS Blog on Machine-to-Machine Authentication](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mt/configuring-machine-to-machine-authentication-with-amazon-cognito-and-amazon-api-gateway-part-2/)
- Agents are treated as App Clients (Cognito terminology)
- MCP Server(s) function as resource servers

#### Authentication Flow:
Run the Agent with the following command:
```{.bash}
python agents/agent_w_auth.py
```
1. Copy `agents/.env.template` to `agents/.env.agent` and set the environment variables (`COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`, `COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`) as appropriate for your setup.
1. Agent startup:
   - Configured with client ID, client secret, and a set of scopes. _Each agent is an App Client in a Cognito user pool_.
   - Requests scopes (e.g., MCP Registry with tool finder and basic MCP servers)
1. Cognito issues a JWT token
1. Agent includes the JWT token in MCP headers
1. Auth server on Nginx side:
   - Retrieves JWT token
   - Calls Cognito to validate token and get allowed scopes
   - Returns 200 or 403 based on:
     - URL (MCP server)
     - Payload (Tools)
     - Agent's allowed scopes

#### Advantages
1. Leverages existing Cognito user identities and groups
1. No need to manage separate M2M credentials for user-initiated actions
1. Maintains user context throughout the session
1. Compatible with existing web-based authentication flow
1. Auth server handles both authentication methods transparently

### 2. Session Cookie Authentication

Session cookie authentication enables agents to act on behalf of users, using their Cognito identity and group memberships for authorization.

#### Implementation Components

##### a. CLI Authentication Tool (`auth_server/cli_auth.py`)

The CLI tool handles the OAuth flow with Cognito and saves the session cookie locally:

```bash
# Run the CLI authentication tool
python agents/cli_auth.py

# This will:
# 1. Open your browser to Cognito hosted UI
# 2. After login, capture the authorization code
# 3. Exchange code for user information
# 4. Create and save session cookie to ~/.mcp/session_cookie
```

Required environment variables:
- `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`: Your Cognito user pool id 
- `COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`: OAuth client ID configured for PKCE flow
- `SECRET_KEY`: Must match the registry's SECRET_KEY for cookie compatibility

##### b. Agent with Session Cookie Support

Copy `agents/.env.template` to `agents/.env.user` and set the environment variables (`COGNITO_CLIENT_ID`, `COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID`, `SECRET_KEY`) as appropriate for your setup.

The agent (`agents/agent_w_auth.py`) supports session cookie authentication:

```bash
# Use agent with session cookie
python agent_w_auth.py \
  --use-session-cookie \
  --message "What time is it in Tokyo?" \
  --mcp-registry-url http://localhost/mcpgw/sse
```

Key features:
- `--use-session-cookie`: Enable session cookie authentication mode
- `--session-cookie-file`: Cookie file path (default: `~/.mcp/session_cookie`)
- Automatically reads cookie and includes in request headers
- Falls back to M2M if session cookie flag not provided

##### c. Auth Server

The auth server validates session cookies alongside JWT tokens:
- Checks for `mcp_gateway_session` cookie in request headers
- Validates cookie signature using `itsdangerous.URLSafeTimedSerializer`
- Maps Cognito groups to MCP scopes using `scopes.yml` configuration:
  - Configuration-driven mapping ensures consistency with M2M authentication
  - Single source of truth for all permission definitions
- Falls back to JWT validation if no valid cookie found

#### Advantages:
- Simpler implementation compared to user-based authentication
- Enables fine-grained control over Agent permissions
- Facilitates secure machine-to-machine communication within the MCP ecosystem

By implementing these enhancements, we can significantly improve the security, scalability, and flexibility of our MCP authentication and authorization system.
