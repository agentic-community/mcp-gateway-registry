## Last Completed Work
- Repo initialized
- Base architecture files created
- Persistence backend for phase 1 selected

## Decisions
- Phase 1 persistence: local SQLite database with storage-agnostic interfaces to enable later migration to Postgres.
- Gateway token signing: RS256 for compatibility; local public-key verification with `kid`-based rotation.
- Credential transport: use `Authorization: Bearer` as canonical; accept `X-Gateway-Token` as fallback; reject ambiguous multi-credential requests.
- Service boundary: extend existing `auth_server` as the EnforceAI stateful enforcement point behind Nginx `auth_request`; keep `registry` optional for management/UI.
- Generic OIDC scope: multi-issuer config map keyed by `iss` (map-of-one allowed), local JWKS validation with caching.
- Agent binding: `agent_id` required for MCP access; from gateway token claim, API key record, or `X-Agent-Id` for OIDC.
- Authorization overlay: runtime enforcement uses agent scopes (and optional allowed-tools) only; enterprise policy is the scope catalog; apply any user baseline at provisioning time.
- Effective scopes for gateway tokens: authorize using `token.scopes ∩ agent.scopes` (token may further restrict but never elevate).
- API key model: `eak_<key_id>.<secret>` with hashed-at-rest verifier using `API_KEY_PEPPER`; agent-bound; `api_key.scopes ∩ agent.scopes` (or agent scopes if unset); future task scoping as an additional restriction dimension.

## Current Task
- Begin implementing the roadmap
- Start OIDC validator design
- Draft database schema for agents

## Next Steps
1. IdentityResolver scaffold
2. Agent registry models
3. Gateway token signing system
